% MediCheck Inference Engine — Forward Chaining
% Medical Diagnosis Expert System — University AI Project
% =============================================================================
%
% FORWARD CHAINING ALGORITHM:
%   1. Start with the FACTS: the reported symptom atoms in WorkingMemory
%   2. Scan ALL diagnostic rules in the knowledge base
%   3. For each rule, check if ALL required symptoms are present in WorkingMemory
%   4. If yes → the rule FIRES: assert the derived fact (diagnosis) and record
%      the rule in the inference chain
%   5. Apply exclusion rules to filter out impossible diagnoses
%   6. Continue until no new facts can be derived (fixed-point / closure)
%   7. Select the best result from all fired diagnoses (highest confidence)
%   8. If nothing fired → return the fallback message
%
% This is a DATA-DRIVEN (forward) approach: we start from symptoms (data)
% and chain forward through rules until we reach a conclusion.
